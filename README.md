Open Source Design for Liquid Reward in Rodent Behavioral Mazes
======

These reward wells are meant to be installed at the ends of a track. When the animal's breaks the infra-red beam at the right
location, liquid reward is delivered either via a pump or valve-controlled gravity-feed system when the animal. 

### Manufacturing
Designs are provided to 3D print the reward well. We have had success with Shapeways "White Strong and Flexible", as well as
printing in-house on our Afinia 3D printer. To prepare the food well, feed wires through the structure of the food well and
solder them to a 5 mm IR LED (e.g., [Digikey part 751-1210](http://www.digikey.com/short/7zhp01)) and a 5 mm IR phototransistor 
(e.g., [Digikey part 475-1080](http://www.digikey.com/short/7zhpv2)). These wires are then soldered to the interface board.

We have ordered interface boards to be manufactured by Seeed Studio, using their PCBA service, at a cost of ~$2/unit.
